# Password-Hashing
This project prompts users to either create a username and password or enter existing username and password.  When user enters new credentials, program uses a hashing algorithm (MD5 hashing algorithm) to hash the credentials and save it to a external file. When user logs in with existing credentials, program will verify and approve login if the user's input matches the hashed credentials.
