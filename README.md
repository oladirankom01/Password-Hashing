# Password-Hashing
This project prompts users to either create a username and password or enter existing username and password.  When user enters new credentials, it then uses a hashing algorithm (MD5 hashing algorithm) to save the hash credentials to a external file. When user logs in with existing credentials, it will be verified and approved if the user's input matches the hashed credentials.
